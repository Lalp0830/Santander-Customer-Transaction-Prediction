At Santander, mission is to help people and businesses prosper. We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals.

Our data science team is continually challenging our machine learning algorithms, working with the global data science community to make sure we can more accurately identify new ways to solve our most common challenge, binary classification problems such as: is a customer satisfied? Will a customer buy this product? Can a customer pay this loan?

In this challenge, we need to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted.

Understanding of data is the very first and important step in the process of finding solution of any business problem. Here in our case our company has provided a data set with following features, we need to go through each and every variable of it to understand and for better functioning.
Our task is to build classification models which will be used to predict which customers will make a specific transaction in the future.
